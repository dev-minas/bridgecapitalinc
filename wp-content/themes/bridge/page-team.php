                Growing up in L.A I spent my youth with my dad at his construction sites. I have always been fascinated with homes and developments so in 2010 I started practicing real estate. In 2012 I transitioned to the home lending world and have not looked back. With vast experience in both worlds you can feel confident that I know what it takes to get the job done. Whether you are a first time home buyer or an experienced investor, I can help you with all your lending needs.

                In 2015 I started the Homes for Trees Project. The plan was simple, plant more trees!!!! With every transaction I close, I donate a tree to the city of Glendale under my clients names. You will receive a certificate along with the coordinates to the tree that has been planted for you and your family. The idea was for the tree to grow as your family grows. In 2016 I took on the role of one of the board of directors for Glendale Beautiful. I have since given up my seat on the board but still work very close with them. If you are interested in donating a tree or donating your time please reach out to me.
